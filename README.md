### Topic Modeling of Jobs using LDA and web scraping with Selenium. 
 - Goal: To build an automated model that will build a data frame CSV with job title, company name, location and job description for multiple listings.  This corpus of job descriptions will be used to determine topics to identify similar skills, requirements and qualifications being asked for in job descriptions. 
 - Status:  Work in progress getting the webscrapping to be robust before moving on the the LDA topic modeling.
