At KLA-Tencor, we're making technology advancements that are bigger—and tinier—than the world has ever seen.  Who are we? We research, develop, and manufacture the world's most advanced inspection and measurement equipment for the semiconductor and nanoelectronics industries. We enable the digital age by pushing the boundaries of technology, creating tools capable of finding defects smaller than a wavelength of visible light. We create smarter processes so that technology leaders can manufacture high-performance chips—the kind in that phone in your pocket, the tablet on your desk and nearly every electronic device you own—faster and better. We're passionate about creating solutions that drive progress and help people do what wouldn't be possible without us. The future is calling. Will you answer? Group/Division With over 38 years of semiconductor process control experience, chipmakers around the globe rely on KLA-Tencor to ensure that their fabs ramp next-generation devices to volume production quickly and cost-effectively. Enabling the movement towards advanced chip design, KLA-Tencor's Patterning Solutions Group (PSG) is looking for the best and the brightest research scientist, software engineers, application development engineers, and senior product technology process engineers to join our 5D team. Our 5D patterning process control technologies control the three dimensions of the device structure, while optimizing the process control loops (time) and minimizing the expense (cost) to create the device; hence five dimensional patterning process control (5D). The team's mission is to collaborate with our customers to innovate hardware and software technologies that detect and control process variations—at their source—rather than compensate for them at later stages of the manufacturing process. These patterning process control solutions provide the most accurate process correctables available today; providing real-time feedback and feed-forward control to improve subsequent process steps. Why join 5D? Think of this team as a ""start-up"" company where you are offered the ultimate challenge to solve the most complex technical problems that enable the digital age. Yet, this ""start-up"" is backed by the most sophisticated and successful process control company in the semiconductor industry. Responsibilities We are looking for a software engineering intern with experience in C/C++ and MATLAB in the field of algorithm development. The successful candidate will be a technical contributor on our computational lithography software development team working on challenging problems in the semiconductor lithography domain. Experience and proven ability to provide software solutions in a scientific environment is essential. Candidate must bring a high level of energy and a willingness to work within KLA-Tencor’s standard software development practices, bring a good attitude and be willing to work with other software professionals in a fast paced and energetic team environment. Job duties will include: Assisting in the development and implementation of highly efficient algorithms and data processing routines, helping with GUI design and implementation.
