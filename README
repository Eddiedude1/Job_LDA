### Topic Modeling of Jobs using LDA and web scraping with Selenium. 
- Goal: To build an automated model that will take inputs: Job Title and location and pull build a CSV file of with all the job descriptions  
        This corpus of job descriptions will be used to determine topics within the corpus to identify key skills, requirements and qualifications  
        being asked for in job descriptions. 
- Status:  Work in progress getting the webscrapping to be robust before moving on the the LDA topic modeling.
